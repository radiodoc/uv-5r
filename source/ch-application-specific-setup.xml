	<para>PLMR users in the United States are mandated to move to 12.5 kHz narrowband communication in the 150-174 MHz VHF and 421-512MHz UHF bands by January 1, 2013.</para>

	<title>Amateur Radio Setup</title>
	<para>In contrast with Commercial radio operators, who often need very specific requirements to be compatible with a very specific radio implementation, Amateur radio operators tend to need the broadest possible settings in order to be compatible with as many systems as possible. This basically implies turning all the fancy features that you typically might need for a commercial setup off.</para>
	<para>In a typical Amateur radio setup the following settings would be recommended:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>Set bandwidth to Wide (menu item 5).</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Turn DCS and CTCSS off (menu items 10 through 13).</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Turn ANI, DTMFST, S-CODE, PTT-ID off and PTT-LT to 0ms  (menu items 15 through 17 and 19 through 20).</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Turn off Squelch Tail Elimination (STE) features (menu items 35 through 37).</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>Turn roger beep (ROGER) off (menu item 39).</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<title>MilSim: Airsoft and Paintball</title>
	<para>If you live in the USA, it is highly recommended that you and your team get yourselves GMRS licenses to use with your radios. At the time of writing the licensing fee is $85 (per person) and the license is valid for five years. There is no exam involved and any legal resident of the US over the age of 18 can apply for a license with the FCC using form 605. Please visit <link xlink:href="http://fcc.gov/"/> for more information.</para>
	<para>The following is a list of recommended GMRS channels suitable for Airsoft games, Paintball games, or other recreational military simulations:</para>
	<simplelist>
		<member><para>462.550 MHz (channel 15)</para></member>
		<member><para>462.575 MHz (channel 16)</para></member>
		<member><para>462.600 MHz (channel 17)</para></member>
		<member><para>462.625 MHz (channel 18)</para></member>
		<member><para>462.725 MHz (channel 22)</para></member>
	</simplelist>
	<note>
		<para>Channel numbers reflect a convention used by Motorola, actual mapping of frequency to channel number may vary between manufacturers.</para>
	</note>
	<para>For those not living in the USA, please contact your local regulatory body in charge of the radio spectrum to see what your options are.</para>
	<warning>
		<para>You may be tempted to use FRS (in the USA) or PMR446 (in Europe) frequencies while playing. Do note however that there are restrictions on both of these bands that make this transceiver illegal for use.</para>
		<para>Not only do you need a radio with a maximum of 500mW output power (the Baofeng UV-5R provides at minimum twice that), you also aren't allowed to use a radio with a detachable antenna or a radio that can be used outside of the FRS or PMR446 bands.</para>
		<para>In the US there is one exception to that rule, and that is FRS+GMRS combo units, however they are still restricted to 500mW output power on the FRS frequencies, and they still have to be manufactured with a fixed integral antenna.</para>
