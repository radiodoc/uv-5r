		<para>Before attaching or removing the battery make sure your radio is turned off by turning the power/volume knob all the way counter-clockwise.</para>
		<section>
			<title>Installation</title>
			<para>Make sure the battery is aligned in parallel with the radio body with the lower edge of the battery about 1-2cm below the edge of the radio.</para>

	<title>Charging and battery maintenance</title>
	<note>
		<para>For optimum battery efficiency, cycle the battery at least three times before regular use.</para>
		<para>A cycle consists of fully charging the battery (about five hours charge time with a standard battery) and then fully depleting it before charging it again.</para>

			<note>
				<para>If your battery has become wet, remove it from the radio, wipe it dry with a towel and put it in a plastic bag with a handful of dry rice. Tie the bag up and let it sit over night. The rice will absorb any remaining moisture in the battery.</para>
				<para>This method is only effective against minor splashes (light rain for instance). A soaked radio may very well be beyond repair.</para>
